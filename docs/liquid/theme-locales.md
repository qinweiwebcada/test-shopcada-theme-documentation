# Theme Locales

---
  Locale files are JSON files that contain a set of translations for text
  strings used throughout the theme and theme editor.
---

In addition to giving merchants a single place to easily edit words and phrases that are repeated throughout the theme, locale files allow you translate storefront content, and theme editor settings, to multiple languages for international merchants and customers.

Example,

```
{
    "headers": {
        "links": {
            "sign_in": "Login",
            "sign_out": "Sign Out",
            "register": "Register",
            "my_account": "My Account",
            "cart": "Cart"
        }
    },
    ...
}
```
